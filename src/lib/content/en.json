      "answer": "Absolutely. We prioritize your privacy and discretion above all else. We use advanced security measures and give you full control over your profile's visibility, including options to hide photos or your profile from public view."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I create a successful profile?",
      "answer": "A great profile is honest, detailed, and features high-quality, recent photos. Be clear about who you are and what you're looking for in an arrangement. This transparency attracts the right kind of partners and sets the foundation for a successful relationship."

    {
      "question": "What is a 'mutually beneficial relationship'?",
      "answer": "It's a relationship where both partners are upfront about their needs and expectations. Typically, a Sugar Daddy provides financial support, mentorship, and a lifestyle upgrade, while a Sugar Baby offers companionship, affection, and enriches the Sugar Daddy's life."

    {
      "question": "How does messaging work on the site?",

    {
      "question": "Can I use the site for free?",
